Site requirements:

*Who is the site meant for?*
3. people interested in the club
1. club members (exec/normal)
2. interested professionals

*What do they want to see?*
  1. A polished site which speaks to NOB and the individual
  2. Easy access to events or calendar with all of the upcoming events
  3. A list of the biggest accomplishments / statistics
  4. Easy access to contact details should they want to sponsor
  5. A professional reference page for the exec members

The site should have:
  1. a simple and clean layout for the landing page
  2. A contact page
  3. An about me page
  4. Upcoming events page
  5. About the team page
  6. An individual page for each exec - they can write that shitAS

1. Landing
  First POC - must be polished
  Two buttons from there:
    1. Upcoming events
    2. Contact me (contact nobemcgill)

  The landing page should also have information "About Me"
  One click to all relevant locations
  Access to eye catching statistics / numbers about club growth etc.

  Continued scrolling should also yield a preview for the "About the Team" page
  higher up execs get front and center attention

2.Upcoming Events
  This should have a threefold purpose
    1. Easy access to available resources for team members
    2. Potential sponsors can see which events they would like to sponsor
    3. Interested recruits can see what the year is like

  An easy-to-use calendar or other potentially integrated method excellent here
  _future_ having an ical ref or google calendar subscription

3. Contact Me
  Here we should be able to contact each exec _position_ professionally
  i.e. if we want to talk finance, we can talk to finace@nobemcgill
  Granular contact methods for each position
  Integrated mail sending

4. About the Team (Landing)
  This is probably what exec members want the most
    1. A chance to show off their position
    2. Easily contact on a exec personal level
    3. Their profile picture and mission statement

  _future_: each picture should be a link to their own bio page
  More thorough description
  There will be _no_ integrated accomplishment listing
  This is not their CV
  It is a chance to express who they are and what they stand for
  LinkedIn is their CV

Header
  This should appear on all pages _except_ the landing page
  One click access to relevant links
    1. Home
    2. Upcoming Events
    3. Contact Me
  Simple

Footer
  This should appear on _all_ pages
  One click access to secondary links:
    1. Meet the team
    2. About the site / Webmaster?
    3. Social Media sites
