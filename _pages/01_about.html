        "Who am I?" now that's an answer that's difficult enough as it is.
        I grew up in Ontario, the place most people think about when you say magic words "Canada".
        When I was a bit older - nine or so, I was swept away into China, where you get most of your cheaply made products.
        That was pretty interesting, and growing up in an International Baccalaureate school definitely gave me a lot to think about.
        Knowing I wanted to become an engineer, but not knowing what kind, I decided to place my bets on as many emerging technologies and I could see and entered into Electrical Engineering.
        Now that's not a subject for the faint of heart.
        I did a lot of hardware, with minimal levels of software and programming.

        <h3>But, as it turns out, programming is incredibly addictive. </h3>
        
        Now more than halfway through my first internship as a backend developer, I thought to myself: all I see are API's, validations, models... how are things on the other side of the fence?
        Covetously, I decided that I wanted to learn a bit of it too.
        And here, you see,
        <h3>The fruits of my labour.</h3>
